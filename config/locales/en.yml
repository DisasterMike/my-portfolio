# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

          I am a software engineer who loves to wear many different hats.
          <br>
          I specialize primarily in <span data-hobby-info-toggle-target='web'><a class='text-link web' href='#'>web development</a></span>.
          Initially I was self taught, but then I went on to study full stack web development at Le Wagon, Tokyo.
          <br>
          <br>
          In my free time I also like to make <span data-hobby-info-toggle-target='games'><a class='text-link' href='#'>video games</a></span> in Unity as a hobby.
          <br>
          In addition, I'm making my own <span data-hobby-info-toggle-target='board'><a class='text-link' href='#'>board games</a></span>, as well as creating my own digital art for my projects.
          Feel free to check out some of my work!
          <br>
          <br>
          I love learning and meeting new people, so feel free to reach out!"

                I have experience in various front-end and back-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and more.
                Next I want to explore some different frame works such as React.\""
  games-info-text: "\"In my free time, I love to create video games using the Unity Engine.
                Over the years, I have made various small to medium projects, which have really helped me to hone my programming skills, such as understanding the importance of scalability and clean clode.
                It's quite the challenge being a solo developer, but I love every second of it!.\""
  board-games-info-text: "\"A few years back, I found a love for board games, and have been designing a few of my own.
                This has really helped me flex my creative muscles and develop my artistic skills. I believe board games have a huge importance on UX and UI design,
                which can be quite a challenging, but very rewarding experience.\""
